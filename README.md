# Site Generator
A tool used to convert markdown files to webpages built for the Boot.dev curriculum

## Running the generator
To run the test suite, run:
```./test.sh```

To run the page generator, run:

To run the page generator and serve the site, run:
```./serve.sh```

## Adding/editing content
Add and modify the markdown files in the content directory to create a site of your own!
To update styling, modify index.css in the static directory (everything in the public directory will be overriden during site generation)
Add/remove images from the static/images folder.
